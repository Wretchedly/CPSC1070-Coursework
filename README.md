## Collaboration Disclaimer
1. All colabs were brainstormed in a team-based lab environment, but all code was done independently from said group.
2. Project 4 was assigned to groups of 2-3, and code was written by myself and one other partner. **For this reason, I do not claim it solely as my own work.**
